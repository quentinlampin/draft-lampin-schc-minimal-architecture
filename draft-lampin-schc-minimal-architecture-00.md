--- abstract

This document investigates the requirements of a minimal architecture for the
  Static Context Header Compression (and fragmentation) protocol (SCHC).
  The intent is to identify the essential components their relationships and
  interfaces. To do so, the document considers scenarios of increasing 
  complexity involving the use of SCHC, from a simple point-to-point
  communication to a more complex deployment involving multiple SCHC Instances
  communicating with each other. In this process, the authors hope to identify
  the essential components of a SCHC architecture and their relationships.

# Introduction        

The SCHC Working Group has developed the {{RFC8724}} SCHC technology for 
  Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) networks, providing efficient header compression
  and fragmentation mechanisms. As SCHC adoption expands beyond its original 
  scope, there is a need to define a minimal architecture that identifies only 
  the essential elements required for proper SCHC operation. This document does
  not aim to replace the SCHC architecture defined in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, but rather
  to investigate the minimal set of components and their relationships that are
  necessary for SCHC to function effectively in various deployment scenarios.


This document provides:

* A definition of the minimal components required for SCHC operation
* The essential interactions between these components
* Problems and challenges addressed by each component

# Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} 
  when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Terminology

This section defines terminology and abbreviations used in this
  document. It borrows from the terminology of {{RFC8724}} and {{DRAFT-ARCH}}.
 
In the following, terms used in the terminology are assumed to be defined in the
  context of the SCHC protocol unless specified otherwise, *.e.g* Endpoint 
  refers to a SCHC Endpoint, Instance refers to a SCHC Instance, and so on.

**Endpoint**: A network host capable of compressing and decompressing headers 
  and optionally fragmenting and reassembling packets. 

**Instance**: A logical component of an Endpoint that implements the SCHC 
  protocol, including header compression, fragmentation, and context management.

**Context**: A set of rules and parameters that define how SCHC operations are 
  performed by `Instances` that implement this `Context`. It includes the Set of 
  Rules (SoR) and the parser ID.

**Endpoint Manager**: A logical component that manages the lifecycle and 
  configuration of `Instances` within an `Endpoint`. It is responsible for 
  creating, updating, and deleting `Instances` as needed, synchronizing 
  `Contexts` and `Profiles`, and managing the `Dispatcher`.

**Session**: A communication session between two `Instances` that 
  share a common context for compression and fragmentation operations. Whenever 
  the `Context` is updated, a new or updated `Session` is established.

**Domain**: A logical grouping of `Instances` that share a common set of 
`Contexts` for compression and fragmentation operations. 

**Dispatcher**: A logical component that routes packets to the appropriate 
  `Instances` based on defined admission rules. It can be integrated into the 
  network stack or implemented as a separate component.

**Profile**: A set of configurations that define how SCHC operations are 
  performed within a specific `Instance`. It includes parameters for the 
  different SCHC components.

**Domain Manager**: A logical component that manages the `Domain`, including 
  context synchronization and profile distribution.

**Context Repository**: A logical component that stores and manages the 
  `Contexts` used by its `Domain`.


# Minimal Architecture Components

In this section, we investigate the minimal components required for SCHC 
  operation in the context of typical deployment scenarios. 

## The simplest deployment scenario

This section considers a simple point-to-point deployment scenario
  where two `Endpoints` communicate with each other using SCHC. The devices are 
  assumed to have a very simple network stack, as shown in the figure below:

~~~~~~~~

                Endpoint A                 Endpoint B    
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |  Application A   |       |  Application B   |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       CoAP       |       |       CoAP       |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       UDP        |       |       UDP        |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       IPv6       |       |       IPv6       |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |  SCHC Instance   |       |  SCHC Instance   |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            | LPWAN Link Layer |       | LPWAN Link Layer |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |  Physical Layer  |       |  Physical Layer  |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
                    |                           |
                    +---------------------------+
~~~~~~~~

In this scenario, 


- Both `Endpoint` A and `Endpoint` B implement the SCHC protocol for header 
  compression and decompression. 
- Both `Endpoints` feature a single application and all traffic is sent and 
  received using the CoAP protocol over UDP over IPv6. 
- The SCHC protocol is used to compress the CoAP, UDP, and IPv6
  headers before sending the packets over the LPWAN link layer. 
- The SCHC protocol is implemented as a single SCHC `Instance` on each 
  `Endpoint`.
- The SCHC `Instance` is hardwired into the protocol stack of each `Endpoint`, 
  meaning that it is not dynamically loaded or unloaded.
- All of the traffic is compressed and decompressed using those `Instances`.

In this simplistic scenario, which is representative of some LPWAN deployments,
 the requirements for the minimal architecture are as follows:

- The Set Of Rules (SoR) of `Endpoint` A MUST be compatible with the SoR of
  `Endpoint` B. Such compatitibility requires that rules IDs and Rule 
  Descriptors are consistent between the two `Instances`. Parsers of both 
  `Instances` MUST be compatible, meaning that they MUST delineate the same 
  header fields in the same order and with the same semantics. 
- Whenever `Endpoint` A compresses a packet, it MUST use the same `Context` as 
  `Endpoint` B. This means that the `Context` MUST be synchronized between the 
  two `Instances`. This communication session is referred to as a `Session`.


### Discussions

**Why `Instance`?** Here we use the term `Instance` to refer to the SCHC 
 protocol routine that is running on each endpoint. This is different from the 
 SCHC Instance defined in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, which refers to a pair of SCHC 
 endpoints that communicate through SCHC. 
 
The rationale for this terminology is that the term `Instance` is often used to
  refer to a specific realization of a class in object-oriented programming, and
  in this case, the SCHC `Instance` is a specific realization of the SCHC 
  protocol that is running on each endpoint.

**Session vs Instance**: In this document, we use the term `Session` to refer to
  a communication session between two (or more) SCHC Instances that are 
  communicating with each other using SCHC, using the same `Context`. 
 
The rationale for this is that the term `Session` is often used to refer to a 
  specific communication session between two endpoints and this definition 
  extends this concept to all SCHC `Instances` that maintain a common context.


## The three endpoints deployment scenario

In this section, we consider a more complex deployment scenario where two or 
 more endpoints communicate with the same SCHC Instance/Endpoint. This scenario 
 is common in IoT deployments where multiple sensors or devices communicate with
 a central gateway or server using SCHC.

 
~~~~~~~~
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|    Endpoint A    |    |    Endpoint B    |    |    Endpoint C    |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  Application A   |    |  Application B   |    |  Application A   |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       CoAP       |    |       CoAP       |    |       CoAP       |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       UDP        |    |       UDP        |    |       UDP        |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       IPv6       |    |       IPv6       |    |       IPv6       |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  SCHC Instance   |    |  SCHC Instance   |    |  SCHC Instance   |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
| LPWAN Link Layer |    | LPWAN Link Layer |    | LPWAN Link Layer |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  Physical Layer  |    |  Physical Layer  |    |  Physical Layer  |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
         |                    |       |                   |          
         +--------------------+       +-------------------+          
~~~~~~~~

In this scenario, we have three `Endpoints`, `Endpoint` A, `Endpoint` B, 
  and `Endpoint` C, that communicate with each other using SCHC. Here, 
  `Endpoint` A and `Endpoint` C are typically sensors or devices that send data 
  to `Endpoint` B, which is a gateway or server that collects and processes the 
  data.
 
We further assume that `Endpoints` A and C have very similar traffic patterns,
  meaning that they send similar packets to Endpoint B. This allows the SCHC
  `Instances` on Host A, B and C to share the same `Context`, which reduces
  the complexity of administration and management of this deployment.
  In the following, we refer to `Instances` that share the same `Contexts` as a 
  `Domain`.


In this typical IoT deployment scenario, the requirements for the minimal 
  architecture are as follows:

- The `Context` of all three `Endpoints` MUST be compatible. This means that
  the SoR, parsers, and rule IDs are consistent between the three `Instances`.
- The `Context` **MUST** be synchronized between the three `Instances`. This
  means that an updated `Session` between all three `Instances` is 
  established whenever the `Context` is updated or modified.
- The `Domain` **MUST** be able to manage the `Contexts` of all `Instances` that
  belong to it. This includes the `Endpoints` enrollment, provisioning of 
  `Contexts` and synchronization. This role is assumed by a logical component of
  the `Domain`, referred to as the `Domain Manager`.


### Discussions

**Why synchronize the `Contexts` of A and C?** Synchronizing the `Contexts` of 
  Endpoint A and Endpoint C is desirable. This reduces the complexity of 
  managing multiple `Contexts` at Endpoint B and eventually reduces the size the
  Rules IDs, impacting the SCHC packet size.

**Domain Manager, why introduce a new function?** In a first approach, the 
  `Domain Manager` could be implemented as a component of the `Instance` that is
  running on an `Endpoint`, here B. However, this would require distinguishing 
  between different types of `Instances`: those capable of managing other 
  instances from those that are not, those that are in charge of managing others
  from those that are not. By separating the `Domain Manager` from the 
  `Instance`, we allow for a more flexible and modular architecture that can be 
  adapted to different deployment scenarios.

**Context compatibility or equality?** While not strictly required, it is 
  desirable that the `Contexts` of all `Instances` that belong to the same 
  `Domain` are equal, meaning that they share the same SoR, parsers, and rule 
  IDs. This simplifies the management of the `Contexts` and reduces the risk of 
  misconfiguration or incompatibility between `Instances`. However, this is not
  strictly required, as long as the `Contexts` are compatible, meaning that they
  can be used interchangeably without causing issues in compression or 
  fragmentation operations.

## The dynamic traffic scenario

In this section, we consider a deployment scenario where multiple `Endpoints` 
  communicate with each other using SCHC, but the traffic patterns of these 
  `Endpoints` are dynamic and change over time. This scenario typically occurs 
  in Smart Buildings applications, where different configurations are deployed 
  based on the current season, occupancy, etc. For example, thermostats 
  setpoints are set differently in winter and summer.

In this scenario, we have three `Endpoints` A, B and C. A, B feature a
  temperature and thermostat functionality, while C is a server that collects 
  and processes the data from A and B.

We further assume that the `Endpoints` A, B and C are first registered with the
  `Domain Manager` of the domain which they are part of, and that they are
  provisioned with an initial `Context`. This `Context` is used to compress the 
  temperature and thermostat data sent by A and B to C, and is tailored to the 
  specifics of the temperatures recorded during winter, and the thermostat 
  setpoints used during this season, as shown in the figure below:

~~~~~~~
      +----------------+
      | Domain Manager |
      +----------------+
              ^    |
1. Endpoints  |    |
  registered  |    |
              |    |   2. Context v1 deployed for winter
              |    +-----------------+-----------------+
              |    |                 |                 |
              |    |                 |                 |
              |    v                 v                 v 
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+ 
            |  Endpoint A  |  |  Endpoint B  |  |  Endpoint C  |
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
~~~~~~~

Then comes the spring, and the temperature and thermostat setpoints change.
  The `Domain Manager` is responsible for updating the `Context` of all 
  `Instances` that belong to the domain, i.e. A, B and C. This update is done
  dynamically, meaning that the `Context` is updated without interrupting the
  communication between the `Endpoints`.

~~~~~~~
+--------------------+
| Application Server |
+--------------------+
  |
  | 1. Submission of a new Context (v2)
  |
  |       +----------------+  Context v2   +--------------------+
  +------>| Domain Manager | <---------->  | Context Repository |
          +----------------+    stored     +--------------------+
                   |
                   |
                   |
                   |        2. Context v2 deployed
                   +-----------------+-----------------+
                   |                 |                 |
                   |                 |                 |
                   v                 v                 v 
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+ 
            |  Endpoint A  |  |  Endpoint B  |  |  Endpoint C  |
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
~~~~~~~

This scenario highlights the need for a dynamic context update mechanism that
  allows the `Domain Manager` to update the `Context` of all `Instances`
  belonging to the `Domain`. 
 
This raises a number of questions, such as:

- How to ensure that all `Instances` are updated with the new `Context`?
- How to process packets sent before the `Context` update but received after?

Answering those specific questions is critical for the proper operation of SCHC
  in this scenario as unsynchronized `Contexts` can lead to packet loss or 
  misinterpretation at the receiving end.

 It is worth noting that the same questions arise in the context of
  configuration management and are possibly addressed by existing IETF
  protocols.

 Nevertheless, we can already identify the need for the following:

- A `Context Repository` that is responsible for storing the `Contexts` of
  the domain. In case of disagreement between `Instances`, the `Context
  Repository` is used to resolve the disagreement. Having one identified source
  of truth for the `Contexts` helps to maintain consistency across the domain.
  This is also useful when (new) nodes join the domain later, as the
  `Context Repository` can provide the necessary `Context` information to new or
  existing `Instances`.
- A mechanism for versioning `Contexts`, allowing the `Domain Manager` to
  manage multiple versions of a `Context` and facilitate rollbacks if needed.
- A mechanism for notifying `Endpoints` of `Context` updates, ensuring that all
  `Endpoints` are aware of the latest `Context` version and can adapt their
  behavior accordingly.

## Multiple SCHC Instances in the same Endpoint

In this scenario, a single `Endpoint` that hosts multiple `Instances` is 
  considered. This scenario involves each `Instance` being configured with
  different `Contexts`. This can be useful for supporting multiple applications
  or services with distinct traffic patterns. One such use-case arises when
  a single `Endpoint` needs to handle different types of traffic, potentially
  sent and received on different network interfaces, each requiring
  its own `Instance` with tailored compression and fragmentation settings.

~~~~~~~~

            Endpoint A                          Endpoint B         
+------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
|    App. 1     |   App. 2     |     |    App. 1     |   App. 2     |
+------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
|     CoAP      |    HTTP      |     |     CoAP      |    HTTP      |

|      UDP      |   UDP/QUIC   |     |      UDP      |   UDP/QUIC   |

|             IPv6             |     |             IPv6             |

|     SCHC      |     SCHC     |     |     SCHC      |     SCHC     |
|  Instance A1  | Instance A2  |     |  Instance B1  | Instance B2  |
+------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
|           Link Layer         |     |           Link Layer         |
+------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
|         Physical Layer       |     |         Physical Layer       |
+------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
                |                                     |
                +-------------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~

In the above example, two `Endpoints`, A and B, each host two `Instances`.
 `Endpoint` A hosts `Instance` A1 and `Instance` A2, while `Endpoint` B hosts
 `Instance` B1 and `Instance` B2. `Instance` A1 and `Instance` B1 are configured
  to handle CoAP traffic and share a common `Context` C1 while `Instance` A2 and
  `Instance` B2 are configured to handle HTTP traffic and share a common 
  `Context` C2.

This new scenario introduces the following challenges:

- **Datagram Dispatch**: The `Endpoint` must be able to dispatch packets to the
  appropriate `Instance` based on the protocol or application in use. This
  requires an additional functional unit, the `Dispatcher`, that can identify
  and dispatch packets to the correct `Instance` for compression and
  fragmentation. Conversely, the `Dispatcher` must also be able to route inbound
  compressed and fragmented packets to the correct `Instance` for decompression
  and reassembly.

  In the above example, uncompressed CoAP/UDP packets must be dispatched to
  `Instances` A1 and B1, while uncompressed HTTP/QUIC packets must be dispatched
  to `Instances` A2 and B2. Additionally, compressed CoAP/UDP packets must be
  dispatched to `Instances` A1 and B1, while compressed HTTP/QUIC packets must
  be dispatched to `Instances` A2 and B2 for decompression. This challenge is
  discussed specifically in section {{sec-dispatcher}}.

- **Instance/Context Identification**: In addition to the need for a `Dispatch`
  mechanism, each `Instance` or `Context` must be uniquely identifiable,
  allowing the `Domain Manager` to update the `Context` of a specific
  `Instance`.

## Heterogeneous Endpoints

This additional scenario introduces heterogeneous `Endpoints` that feature
  different hardware and software configurations. These differences may include
  the Operating System (OS) or the hardware on which the `Instance` is run.
  Those differences are the source of a challenge in the deployment of
  `Instances` in configurations.

To illustrate this challenge, we consider the following example, illustrated in
  the figure below, where two `Endpoints` A and B are both running the same
  OS, here a Linux-based distribution using udev for device management, but on
  two different hardware platforms.

~~~~~~~~

`Endpoint` A features an Ethernet interface which is located on the mainboard
  and is referred to as `eno0`:  *en* standing for "Ethernet",
*o* for "onboard", and *0* for "index 0" in the udev naming convention.

`Endpoint` B features an Ethernet interface which is located on a PCI bus and
  is referred to as `enp2s0`: *en* standing for "Ethernet", *p* for "PCI",
  *2* for "bus 2", and *s0* for "slot 0" in the same naming convention.

In this scenario, the `Context` which contains the Set of Rules (SoR) and parser
  ID, i.e. the configuration which is shared by all `Instances` of a `Domain`,
  provides no information on how to instruct the `Dispatcher` to route packets
  from the appropriate Network Interface to the appropriate `Instance`.

Without further configuration and unless the `Dispatcher` intercepts all packets
  from all network interfaces, we cannot guarantee the correct dispatching of
  packets to the appropriate `Instances`. Obviously, intercepting traffic from
  all network interfaces is not a viable solution, as it would require the
  inspection of all packets, regardless of their destination, which requires
  significant processing power and may introduce unacceptable latency on
  high-speed links.

Additionally, different OSes may use different filtering/dispatch frameworks,
  e.g. Netfilter on Linux, BPF on FreeBSD, PF on OpenBSD and macOS etc. This
  means that the foundation on which the `Dispatcher` implementation relies may
  vary significantly between different platforms and could require different
  configurations to dispatch packets to `Instances` based on the same `Context`
  but running on different `Endpoints`.

This assessment advocates for the introduction of a device-specific
  configuration that is independent of the `Context`, which we name `Profile`.
  
Such `Profiles` are `Endpoint` specific so their actual content is out of scope
  of this document. However, the `Profile` **SHALL** include the following:

- The configuration of the `Dispatcher`, i.e. the admission rules for 
  compression and decompression.
- The rule matching policy, i.e. the policy used to select the appropriate
  compression or decompression rule based on the SCHC packet and the `Context`.

As the `Profile` is `Endpoint` specific, it is not shared between `Instances` of
  different `Endpoints`. However, the `Profile` required for a given `Instance`
  may need to change when the `Context` is updated, e.g. the filtering rules may
  need to be adjusted to account for the new traffic patterns and C/D rules.

This means that the `Profile` may need to be updated whenever the `Context` is
  updated, and that the `Domain Manager` **SHALL** therefore be responsible for
  managing the `Profile` delivery to `Instances` and their synchronization with
  the `Context`.

## The cold boot scenario

In this scenario, we consider the case where an `Endpoint` A is powered on and
  needs to establish a SCHC `Session` with another `Endpoint` B. `Endpoint` A
  does not have any `Context` or `Profile` stored in memory, and it needs to
  retrieve or negotiate this information before establishing the session.

  Two hypothetical scenarios are considered here:

  - *S1*. `Endpoint` A is provisioned on the appropriate `Domain` and is
    configured with the address/URI of the `Domain Manager` and
    `Context Repository`.
  - *S2*. `Endpoint` A is provisioned on the appropriate `Domain` but is not
    configured with the address/URI of the `Domain Manager` and 
    `Context Repository`. In this scenario, the `Domain Manager` is in charge of
    advertising its presence and push the context to `Endpoint` A.
  
In scenario *S1*, `Endpoint` A initiates the configuration phase, effectively
  pulling the `Context` and `Profile` from the `Domain Manager` and the
  `Context Repository`. This scenario implies that the `Domain Manager` exposes
  a management interface that allows `Endpoints` to retrieve the necessary
  configuration information. Additionally, a logical component referred to as
  `Endpoint Manager` is required to manage the `Instances` of the `Endpoint`.

In scenario *S2*, the `Domain Manager` is in charge of advertising its presence
  and `Endpoint` A is pulling the `Contexts` and `Profiles` from it.
  The advertisement can be done using a discovery mechanism, such as DNS-SD or a
  predefined multicast address. This scenario implies that `Endpoints` are
  capable of discovering the `Domain Manager` and retrieving the necessary
  configuration information. This further requires that `Endpoints` feature a
  service discovery mechanism and a `Management Protocol` that enables them to
  interact with the `Domain Manager` and request the required `Context` and
  `Profile`.

In both scenarios, a management protocol is required to enable the retrieval
  of the `Context` and `Profile` from the `Domain Manager`. {{DRAFT-CORECONF}}
  provides initial ideas on how to implement such a management protocol for SCHC
  in a Constrained Environment, e.g. IoT devices.

## Core Components Illustrated

This section provides an overview of the SCHC Core components their interactions
and key functionalities and interfaces.

### Endpoint

An `Endpoint` is a network host capable of compressing and decompressing headers
  and optionally fragmenting and reassembling packets. It implements the SCHC
  protocol as defined in {{RFC8724}}. An `Endpoint` can host multiple
  `Instances`, each with its own `Context` and `Profile`.

### Instance

An `Instance` is the fundamental component that implements the SCHC protocol
  as defined in {{RFC8724}}. An `Endpoint` MAY execute several `Instances` in 
  its protocol stack. Each `Instance` operates independently, with its own 
  context and profile. 

A functional architecture of a SCHC Instance is proposed in the following 
  figure:

|  | - decompress(buffer) |    | - reassemble(fragments) |    |
|  +----------------------+    +-------------------------+    |
|                                                             |
|                                                             |

|  |   +-------------------+    +-------------------+    |    |
|  +-----------------------------------------------------+    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~

A SCHC Instance MUST implement the following components:

* Header Compression and Decompression (C/D) engine
* Context Manager
* Profile Manager

Its configuration MUST include:

* a SCHC Context, which defines the set of C/D and F/R rules - or Set of Rules -
 and the parser to be used to delineate the header field.
* a SCHC Profile, which defines the configuration of the Dispatch Engine, the 
 rule matching policy, and the device-specific configuration.


A SCHC Instance MAY implement:

* Fragmentation and Reassembly (F/R) functionality
* Dynamic context update mechanisms
* Performance monitoring and reporting

#### Header Compression and Decompression (C/D) engine

This component is responsible for compressing and decompressing headers
 using the SCHC protocol, as described in {{RFC8724}}. It applies the rules 
 defined in the SCHC Context.
  
The C/D engine MUST expose the following interface:

- `compress(buffer, context, profile)`: Compresses the provided buffer using the
   SCHC Context and the profile.
- `decompress(buffer, context, profile)`: Decompresses the provided buffer using
   the SCHC Context and the profile.

Internally, on compression, the C/D engine:

- delineates the fields using the parser identified in the SCHC Context.
- chooses the appropriate compression rule based on the SCHC Context and the 
 matching policy defined in the profile.
- applies the compression rule to the fields of the header.
- generates the compressed SCHC packet.
  
On decompression, the C/D engine:

- identifies the C/D rule based on the SCHC compressed packet.
- applies the decompression rules to reconstruct the original header.
- reconstructs the original packet from the decompressed header and payload.

#### Fragmentation and Reassembly (F/R)

This component is responsible for fragmenting larger packets into smaller
 fragments and reassembling them at the receiving end. It is optional in
 the minimal architecture but recommended for scenarios where packet sizes
 exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying network.


### SCHC Session

As illustrated in the figure below, the `Session` is a communication session 
  between two or more `Instances` that share a common `Context`, i.e. they are 
  part of the same `Domain`. It is established whenever the `Context` is updated
  or modified.

                           Session                            
                          /       \                           
+------------------+     /         \      +------------------+

   Endpoint C                                  Endpoint D     

~~~~~~~~




### SCHC Domain & Domain Manager

The SCHC `Domain` is an administrative unit, whose role is to manage the SCHC 
  Contexts of all `Instances` that belong to it. The `Domain Manager` is the
  component responsible for this management. It handles Endpoints Enrollment, 
  and `Context` synchronization.

### Dispatcher {#sec-dispatcher}

The Dispatcher is responsible for delivering compressed packets to the
 correct SCHC `Instance`. It ensures that the compressed packets are sent
 to the appropriate destination and that the decompressed packets are
 delivered to the correct application or protocol routine.

The Dispatcher is a key component that enables the coexistence of multiple
 SCHC `Instances` on the same network host, allowing different protocols or
 applications to use SCHC compression and decompression mechanisms. It also
 allows regular traffic to coexist with SCHC-compressed traffic.

Dispatcher is illustrated in the figure below, where two SCHC `Instances`
 are running on the same `Endpoint`. The Dispatcher is responsible for routing
 packets to the appropriate `Instance` based on the filter chains defined in
 each `Profile`.

The Dispatcher MUST implement the following interface:
- `register_compression_hook(admission_rules)`:
  registers a compression hook with the Dispatch Engine, which is used to 
  identify packets that should be compressed by SCHC. The admission rules 
  define the criteria for packet selection, such as specific header fields or 
  values.
- `register_decompression_hook(admission_rules)`:
  registers a decompression hook with the Dispatch Engine, which is used to 
  identify packets that should be decompressed by SCHC. The admission rules 
  define the criteria for packet selection, such as specific header fields or 
  values.


**Dispatch scenarios**:

#### Case 1: The Dispatch Engine is integrated into the network stack and a single SCHC Instance is used.

~~~~~~

In this simple scenario, the Dispatch Engine is integrated into
  the network stack and there is a unique predefined SCHC Instance for a 
  specific protocol stack, such as CoAP over UDP over IPv6. This is the classic 
  case for SCHC over LPWAN networks, as described in {{RFC8724}}, {{RFC8824}}, 
  {{RFC9363}}.

The dispatching is done based on a identified header field, such as the an 
  ethertype, the IPv6 Next Header field, a specific UDP port, etc.
 
This implementation scenario therefore assumes that the endpoint Operating 
  System (OS) implements the SCHC protocol as part of its network stack and that 
  SCHC is allocated the appropriate ethertype, IPv6 Next Header value or UDP 
  port from IANA.

In the example above, 

* On Endpoint 1, the Dispatch "intercepts" outbound packets whose UDP 
  destination port is 5678, which is used by CoAP. It then routes these packets 
  to the SCHC Instance for CoAP over UDP over IPv6. The SCHC instance 
  then compresses the CoAP, UDP and IPv6 headers, and calls the Link Layer
  interface to send the compressed packet over the network, setting the
  appropriate SCHC ethertype in the link layer header.

* On Endpoint 2, incoming packets whose SCHC ethertype is set to the SCHC value
  are routed to the SCHC Instance for CoAP over UDP over IPv6. The SCHC Instance
  decompresses the SCHC packets and delivers them to the IPv6 layer.

Note that in this example, regular HTTP over QUIC traffic is also present on the
  same Endpoint. The Dispatch Engine is able to discriminate those packets from 
  packets that are compressed by SCHC, as the HTTP over QUIC packets do not
  not match the admission rules defined in the SCHC profile, here
  `UDP Destination Port == 5678`.


#### Case 2: The Dispatch engine lives outside of the network stack.

In this case, the Dispatch Engine is a separate component that
  interacts with multiple SCHC Instances. It is responsible for routing packets
  to the appropriate SCHC Instance based on the packet type and supplied
  admission rules. 

 - On Linux, this can be implemented using netfilter hooks or similar mechanisms
  to intercept packets and route them to and from the appropriate SCHC Instance.

 - On macOS, the Dispatch Engine can be implemented as a kernel extension or 
  user-space application that make use of PF, the native packet filter.

The exact implementation details of the Dispatch Engine will depend on the 
  Operating System, which therefore is not specified in this document. However,
  a description of packets criteria and admission rules is provided in the SCHC 
  profile, which is used by the Dispatch Engine to determine how to route 
  packets.

~~~~~~~

In the example above, the Dispatch Engine is implemented as a filter that 
  intercepts packets based on their UDP destination port. In this instance, it 
  routes packets with a destination port of 5768 to the SCHC Instance for CoAP 
  over UDP over IPv6. The Dispatch Engine then compresses the CoAP, UDP, and
  IPv6 headers, adds a MPLS header with appropriate tag and sends the compressed 
  packet over the network.

When receiving packets, the Dispatch Engine checks the SCHC ethertype and MPLS 
  label and routes matching packets (MPLS label == 0xabcd0180 && UDP destination 
  port == 5768) them to the appropriate SCHC Instance based on the defined 
  admission rules in the profile.


### Context Management {#sec-context-management}

Context management is responsible for maintaining the shared state between
  SCHC entities. This includes:

* Context synchronization between entities
* Rule lifecycle management
* Profile distribution and updates

### Context Repository {#sec-context-repository}

A Context Repository provides centralized storage and management of SCHC
  contexts and profiles. While not mandatory for minimal deployments, it
  becomes essential for larger deployments requiring centralized management.

### Management Interface {#sec-management-interface}

A Management Interface provides operational control and monitoring
  capabilities for SCHC deployments. This may include:

* Configuration management
* Performance monitoring
* Troubleshooting tools

# Security Considerations

Security considerations for SCHC minimal architecture include:

* Context integrity and authenticity
* Profile distribution security
* Protection against context manipulation attacks

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
