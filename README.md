# SCHC Minimal Architecture

This repository contains the IETF draft "SCHC Minimal Architecture" by Quentin Lampin (Orange).

## Abstract

Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional fragmentation mechanism. This document defines a minimal architecture for SCHC deployments, providing guidance for implementers and operators on the essential components and their interactions required for effective SCHC operation.

## Building the Draft
