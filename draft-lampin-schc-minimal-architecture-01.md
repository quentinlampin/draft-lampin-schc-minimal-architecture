--- abstract

This document investigates the requirements of a minimal architecture for the
  Static Context Header Compression (and fragmentation) protocol (SCHC).
  The intent is to identify the essential components their relationships and
  interfaces. To do so, the document considers scenarios of increasing
  complexity involving the use of SCHC, from a simple point-to-point
  communication to a more complex deployment involving multiple SCHC Instances
  communicating with each other. In this process, the authors hope to identify
  the essential components of a SCHC architecture and their relationships.

# Introduction

The SCHC Working Group has developed the {{RFC8724}} SCHC protocol for
  Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) networks, providing efficient header compression
  and fragmentation mechanisms. As SCHC adoption expands beyond its original
  scope, there is a need to define a minimal architecture that identifies only
  the essential elements required for proper SCHC operation. This document does
  not aim to replace the SCHC architecture defined in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, but rather
  to investigate the minimal set of components and their relationships that are
  necessary for SCHC to function effectively in various deployment scenarios.


This document provides:

* A definition of the minimal components required for SCHC operation
* The essential interactions between these components
* Problems and challenges addressed by each component

# Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
  when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Methodology

To identify the minimal architecture components required for SCHC operation, this
  document considers a series of deployment scenarios of increasing complexity.
  Each scenario introduces new requirements and challenges that need to be
  addressed by the architecture. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to
  identify the essential components and their relationships that are necessary
  for SCHC to function effectively.

A particular care is taken to ensure that the minimal architecture remains
  compatible with existing RFCs and maintains consistency in its terminology and
  functional description.

To this end, the document considers the LPWAN deployment scenarios as a starting
  point, as they represent the original use case for SCHC. Further scenarios
  are then considered, which gradually introduce the new requirements and
  challenges that are relevant to SCHC operation in more complex environments.

Each scenario is analyzed in detail, and the components required to address the
  challenges introduced by that scenario are identified. The relationships
  between these components are also described, highlighting how they interact
  to provide the necessary functionality for SCHC operation. The terminology is
  discussed to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the document and with
  existing RFCs.

# Terminology

This section defines terminology and abbreviations used in this document. It
  borrows from the terminology of {{RFC8724}} and {{DRAFT-ARCH}}.

In the following, terms used in the terminology are assumed to be defined in the
  context of the SCHC protocol unless specified otherwise, *.e.g* Endpoint
  refers to a SCHC Endpoint, Instance refers to a SCHC Instance, and so on.

**Endpoint**: A network host capable of compressing and decompressing headers
  and optionally fragmenting and reassembling packets.

**Instance**: A logical component of an `Endpoint` that implements the SCHC
  protocol, including header compression and optionally fragmentation, and
  context management.

**Context**: A set of rules and parameters that define how SCHC operations are
  performed by `Instances` that implement this `Context`. It includes the
  `Set of Rules`, the `Context ID`, the `Context Version`, the 
  `Direction Indicator` and the `parser ID`.

   - **Context ID**: A unique identifier for a `Context` within a `Domain`.
   - **Context Version**: A version identifier for a `Context`, used to manage
     updates and changes to the `Context` over time.
   - **Parser ID**: An identifier that specifies the parser used to delineate
     header fields in packets processed by the `Instance`.
   - **Set of Rules (SoR)**: A collection of Rule entries that define how
     specific header fields are compressed and fragmented by an `Instance`.
   - **Direction Indicator**: A parameter that indicates on which end an
     `Instance` is operating (uplink or downlink) for the Set of Rules of the
     `Context`.

**Profile**: A set of configurations that define how SCHC operations are
  performed within a specific `Instance`. It includes parameters for the
  different SCHC components that support the execution of the `Instance`.

**Endpoint Manager**: A logical component that manages the lifecycle and
  configuration of `Instances` within an `Endpoint`. It is responsible for
  creating, updating, and deleting `Instances` as needed, synchronizing
  `Contexts` and `Profiles`, and managing the `Dispatcher`.

**Session**: A communication session between two `Instances` or more that
  share a common context for compression and fragmentation operations. Whenever
  the `Context` is updated, a new or updated `Session` is established.

**Domain**: A logical grouping of `Instances` that share a common set of
  `Contexts` for compression and fragmentation operations.

**Domain Manager**: A logical component that manages the `Domain`, including
  context synchronization and profile distribution.

**Context Repository**: A logical component that stores and manages the
  `Contexts` used by its `Domain`.

**Dispatcher**: A logical component of the `Endpoint` that routes packets to the
  appropriate `Instances` based on defined admission rules. It can be integrated
  into the network stack or implemented as a separate component.


# Minimal Architecture Components, a case study & discussions

In this section, we investigate the minimal components required for SCHC
  operation in the context of typical deployment scenarios.

## The simplest deployment scenario

This section considers a simplified deployment scenario where an IoT device
  communicates with a gateway or server using SCHC for header compression and
  decompression. In this scenario, we assume that both the device and the
  gateway feature a single application and all traffic is sent and received
  using the CoAP protocol over UDP over IPv6. SCHC is used to compress the CoAP,
  UDP, and IPv6 headers before sending the datagrams over the LPWAN link layer.
  SCHC is used as an adaptation layer between the IPv6 layer and the LPWAN link
  layer to compress the headers of the datagrams such that they fit within the
  constraints of the LPWAN link layer.


~~~~~~~~
             Host A, IoT Device       Host B, Gateway/Server
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |  Application A   |       |  Application B   |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       CoAP       |       |       CoAP       |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       UDP        |       |       UDP        |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       IPv6       |       |       IPv6       |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |       SCHC       |       |       SCHC       |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            | LPWAN Link Layer |       | LPWAN Link Layer |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
            |  Physical Layer  |       |  Physical Layer  |
            +------------------+       +------------------+
                    |                           |
                    +---------------------------+
~~~~~~~~

Albeit simplistic, this scenario captures the essential components and
  interactions required for SCHC operation in a typical LPWAN deployment.
  We can already identify key components of the SCHC architecture and a first
  set of requirements that need to be addressed.

Before discussing those requirements, we first need to discuss the terminology
  and align it with existing RFCs and the requirements of the SCHC working
  group.

### Terminology discussion

While IoT Devices and Gateways/Servers are commonly used in the LPWAN
  terminology, we need here to adopt a term that encompasses both entities and
  extends to other deployment scenarios where network hosts are neither an IoT
  device nor a Gateway/Server. Reviewing the terminology used in existing RFCs
  and drafts on SCHC, most notably {{RFC8724}} and {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, we propose to
  use the term `Endpoint` to refer to network hosts that implement SCHC.

Additionally, we need a name for SCHC protocol routines that are running on
  each `Endpoint`. We propose to adopt the term `Instance` to refer to the SCHC
  protocol routine that is running on each `Endpoint`. This choice is aligned
  with the terminology used in existing RFCs published by the LPWAN working
  group. For example,
  
  in {{RFC9363}}:
  
  ```
  This document formalizes the description of the Rules for
  better interoperability between SCHC instances either to
  exchange a set of Rules or to modify the parameters of some
  Rules.
  ```

  in {{RFC8824}}:
  
  ```
  CoAP is an application protocol, so CoAP compression requires
  installing common Rules between the two SCHC instances.
  ```

  and in {{RFC9441}}: 

  ```
  Therefore, a device must be allowed to modify only its own
  Rules on the remote SCHC instance.
  ```

This is different from the SCHC Instance defined in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, which means
  a session:
  ```
  SCHC Instance. The **session** between SCHC end points in two or more peer
    nodes operating SCHC to communicate using a common SoR and a matching SoV.
    There are 2 SCHC Instances or more involved per SCHC stratum, one for the
    SCHC Stratum Header and one or more for the SCHC payload, i.e., the
    SCHC-compressed data.
  ```

For clarity and coherence with existing terminology, we propose that the term
  `Session` be used to refer to the communication session between two (or more)
  SCHC `Instances`.

### Functional requirements

This scenario is a simplified representation of a typical LPWAN deployment where
  an IoT device communicates with a gateway or server using SCHC for header
  compression and decompression.

In this scenario,

- Both `Endpoint` A and `Endpoint` B implement the SCHC protocol for header
  compression and decompression.
- Both `Endpoints` feature a single application and all traffic is sent and
  received using the CoAP protocol over UDP over IPv6.
- The SCHC protocol is used to compress the CoAP, UDP, and IPv6
  headers before sending the packets over the LPWAN link layer.
- The SCHC protocol is implemented as a single `Instance` on each
  `Endpoint`.
- The `Instance` is hardwired into the protocol stack of each `Endpoint`,
  meaning that it is not dynamically loaded or unloaded.
- All of the traffic is compressed and decompressed using those `Instances`.

In this scenario, the `Instances` on both `Endpoints` rely on a `Session` to
  communicate using SCHC for header compression and decompression. For the
  `Session` to be successful, both `Instances` must agree on the compression
  rules in use. More specifically, when the `Instance` on `Endpoint` A
  compresses a datagram, the rule used for compression **MUST** be known to the
  `Instance` on `Endpoint` B, that is, the Set of Rules (SoR) of `Endpoint` A
  and `Endpoint` B **MUST** both contain said rule with the same Rule ID. This
  requires that both `Instances` have compatible SoRs, meaning that the Rule IDs
  and Rule Descriptors are consistent between the two `Instances`. Parsers of
  both `Instances` MUST be compatible, meaning that they MUST delineate the same
  header fields in the same order.

  Additionnaly, both `Instances` must also agree on their respective roles with
  regard to the `Direction Indicator` (DI) used in the Rule Entries.




## The three endpoints deployment scenario

In this section, we consider a more complex deployment scenario where two or
  more endpoints communicate with the same SCHC Instance/Endpoint. This scenario
  is common in IoT deployments where multiple sensors or devices communicate
  with a central gateway or server using SCHC.

~~~~~~~~

     Endpoint A              Endpoint B              Endpoint C
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  Application A   |    |  Application B   |    |  Application A   |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       CoAP       |    |       CoAP       |    |       CoAP       |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       UDP        |    |       UDP        |    |       UDP        |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|       IPv6       |    |       IPv6       |    |       IPv6       |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  SCHC Instance   |    |  SCHC Instance   |    |  SCHC Instance   |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
| LPWAN Link Layer |    | LPWAN Link Layer |    | LPWAN Link Layer |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
|  Physical Layer  |    |  Physical Layer  |    |  Physical Layer  |
+------------------+    +------------------+    +------------------+
         |                    |       |                   |
         +--------------------+       +-------------------+
~~~~~~~~

In this scenario, we have three `Endpoints`, `Endpoint` A, `Endpoint` B,
  and `Endpoint` C, that communicate with each other using SCHC. Here,
  `Endpoint` A and `Endpoint` C are typically sensors or devices that send data
  to `Endpoint` B, which is a gateway or server that collects and processes the
  data.

We further assume that `Endpoints` A and C have very similar traffic patterns,
  meaning that they send similar packets to Endpoint B. This allows the SCHC
  `Instances` on Hosts A, B and C to share the same `Context`, which reduces
  the complexity of administration and management of this deployment.
  In the following, we refer to `Instances` that share the same `Contexts` as a
  `Domain`.


In this typical IoT deployment scenario, the requirements for the minimal
  architecture are as follows:

- The `Context` of all three `Endpoints` MUST be compatible. This means that
  the SoR, parsers, and rule IDs are consistent between the three `Instances`.
- The `Context` **MUST** be synchronized between the three `Instances`. This
  means that an updated `Session` between all three `Instances` is
  established whenever the `Context` is updated or modified.
- The `Domain` **MUST** be able to manage the `Contexts` of all `Instances` that
  belong to it. This includes the `Endpoints` enrollment, provisioning of
  `Contexts` and synchronization. This role is assumed by a logical component of
  the `Domain`, referred to as the `Domain Manager`.

**Why synchronize the `Contexts` of A and C?** Synchronizing the `Contexts` of
  Endpoint A and Endpoint C is desirable. This reduces the complexity of
  managing multiple `Contexts` at Endpoint B and eventually reduces the size the
  Rules IDs, impacting the SCHC packet size.

**Domain Manager, why introduce a new entity?** In a first approach, the
  `Domain Manager` could be implemented as a component of the `Instance` that is
  running on an `Endpoint`, here B. However, this would require distinguishing
  between different types of `Instances`: those capable of managing other
  instances from those that are not, those that are in charge of managing others
  from those that are not. By separating the `Domain Manager` from the
  `Instance`, we allow for a more flexible and modular architecture that can be
  adapted to different deployment scenarios.

**SoR compatibility or equality?** In this scenario, we require that the SoRs of
  all `Instances` involved in a Domain be compatible. However, the SoRs do not
  need to be identical, meaning that Host A and Host C can have rules that are
  only shared with But not with each other. Such rules are desirable to support
  the compression of host-specific traffic characteristics, such as addresses or
  port numbers. Obviously, those host-specific rules MUST feature different Rule
  IDs to avoid conflicts. This requirement promotes flexibility and scalability
  in the management of `Contexts` in larger deployments.


## The dynamic traffic scenario

In this section, we consider a deployment scenario where multiple `Endpoints`
  communicate with each other using SCHC, but the traffic patterns of these
  `Endpoints` are dynamic and change over time. This scenario typically occurs
  in Smart Buildings applications, where different configurations are deployed
  based on the current season, occupancy, etc. For example, thermostats
  setpoints are set differently in winter and summer.

In this scenario, we have three `Endpoints` A, B and C. A, B feature a
  temperature and thermostat functionality, while C is a server that collects
  and processes the data from A and B.

We further assume that the `Endpoints` A, B and C are first registered with the
  `Domain Manager` of the domain which they are part of, and that they are
  provisioned with an initial `Context`. This `Context` is used to compress the
  temperature and thermostat data sent by A and B to C, and is tailored to the
  specifics of the temperatures recorded during winter, and the thermostat
  setpoints used during this season, as shown in the figure below:

~~~~~~~
      +----------------+
      | Domain Manager |
      +----------------+
              ^    |
1. Endpoints  |    |
  registered  |    |
              |    |   2. Context v1 deployed for winter
              |    +-----------------+-----------------+
              |    |                 |                 |
              |    |                 |                 |
              |    v                 v                 v
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
            |  Endpoint A  |  |  Endpoint B  |  |  Endpoint C  |
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
~~~~~~~

Then comes the spring, and the temperature and thermostat setpoints change.
  The `Domain Manager` is responsible for updating the `Context` of all
  `Instances` that belong to the domain, i.e. A, B and C. This update is done
  dynamically, meaning that the `Context` is updated without interrupting the
  communication between the `Endpoints`.

~~~~~~~
+--------------------+
| Application Server |
+--------------------+
     |
     | 1. Submission of a new Context (v2)
     |
     |    +----------------+  Context v2   +--------------------+
     +--->| Domain Manager | <---------->  | Context Repository |
          +----------------+    stored     +--------------------+
                   |
                   |
                   |
                   |        2. Context v2 deployed
                   +-----------------+-----------------+
                   |                 |                 |
                   |                 |                 |
                   v                 v                 v
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
            |  Endpoint A  |  |  Endpoint B  |  |  Endpoint C  |
            +--------------+  +--------------+  +--------------+
~~~~~~~


This scenario highlights the need for a dynamic context update mechanism that
  allows the `Domain Manager` to update the `Context` of all `Instances`
  belonging to the `Domain`.

This raises a number of questions, such as:

- How to ensure that all `Instances` are updated with the new `Context`?
- How to process packets sent before the `Context` update but received after?

Answering those specific questions is critical for the proper operation of SCHC
  in this scenario as unsynchronized `Contexts` can lead to packet loss or
  misinterpretation at the receiving end.

 It is worth noting that the same questions arise in the context of
  configuration management and are possibly addressed by existing IETF
  protocols.

 Nevertheless, we can already identify the need for the following:

- A `Context Repository` that is responsible for storing the `Contexts` of
  the domain. In case of disagreement between `Instances`, the `Context
  Repository` is used to resolve the disagreement. Having one identified source
  of truth for the `Contexts` helps to maintain consistency across the domain.
  This is also useful when (new) nodes join the domain later, as the
  `Context Repository` can provide the necessary `Context` information to new or
  existing `Instances`.
- A mechanism for versioning `Contexts`, allowing the `Domain Manager` to
  manage multiple versions of a `Context` and facilitate rollbacks if needed.
- A mechanism for notifying `Endpoints` of `Context` updates, ensuring that all
  `Endpoints` are aware of the latest `Context` version and can adapt their
  behavior accordingly.

Additionally, aside from architectural considerations, this scenario highlights
  the need for a `Context` model distinct from the Set of Rules (SoR), defining
  the content and structure of a `Context`. Currently, the SCHC data model
  ({{RFC9363}}) provides no description for `Contexts` while {{RFC8724}}
  describes the `Context` as a set of rules.

At a minimum, the `Context` model MUST include:
- a `Context` Unique Identifier within the Domain.
- a version identifier.
- The Set of Rules (SoR).
- The parser ID.




## Multiple SCHC Instances in the same Endpoint

In this scenario, a single `Endpoint` that hosts multiple `Instances` is
  considered. This scenario involves each `Instance` being configured with
  different `Contexts`. This can be useful for supporting multiple applications
  or services with distinct traffic patterns. One such use-case arises when
  a single `Endpoint` needs to handle different types of traffic, potentially
  sent and received on different network interfaces, each requiring
  its own `Instance` with tailored compression and fragmentation settings.

In the above example, two `Endpoints`, A and B, each host two `Instances`.
  `Endpoint` A hosts `Instance` A1 and `Instance` A2, while `Endpoint` B hosts
  `Instance` B1 and `Instance` B2. `Instance` A1 and `Instance` B1 are 
  configured to handle CoAP traffic and share a common `Context` C1 while 
  `Instance` A2 and `Instance` B2 are configured to handle HTTP traffic and 
  share a common `Context` C2.

This new scenario introduces the following challenges:

- **Datagram Dispatch**: The `Endpoint` must be able to dispatch packets to the
  appropriate `Instance` based on the protocol or application in use. This
  requires an additional functional entity, the `Dispatcher`, that can identify
  and dispatch packets to the correct `Instance` for compression and
  fragmentation. Conversely, the `Dispatcher` must also be able to route inbound
  compressed and fragmented packets to the correct `Instance` for decompression
  and reassembly.

  In the above example, uncompressed CoAP/UDP packets must be dispatched to
  `Instances` A1 and B1, while uncompressed HTTP/QUIC packets must be dispatched
  to `Instances` A2 and B2. Additionally, compressed CoAP/UDP packets must be
  dispatched to `Instances` A1 and B1, while compressed HTTP/QUIC packets must
  be dispatched to `Instances` A2 and B2 for decompression. The criteria for
  dispatching compressed packets to the correct `Instance` is called the
  `Discriminator` in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}.

  Those challenges are discussed further in section {{sec-dispatcher}}.

- **Instance/Context Identification**: In addition to the need for a `Dispatch`
  mechanism, which addresses the routing of packets to the correct `Instance`,
  each `Instance` or `Context` must be uniquely identifiable to allow the
  `Domain Manager` to update the `Context` of a specific `Instance`.


**Dispatcher and Discriminator** In {{DRAFT-ARCH}}, the authors introduce
  the concept of a `Discriminator` that is used to identify the `Instance` or
  `Context` that must be used to decompress a packet. As explained in the
  document, the `Discriminator` is a criterion that is used to select the
  appropriate `Instance` or `Context` for decompression.

The `Dispatcher` is different from the `Discriminator` in that it is the
  functional unit responsible for routing packets to the correct `Instance`
  based on:

  - the `Discriminator` value for decompression and reassembly.
  - the `Matching Operators` and `Target Values` of the `Contextes` for
   compression and fragmentation.

## Heterogeneous Endpoints

This additional scenario introduces heterogeneous `Endpoints` that feature
  different hardware and software configurations. These differences may include
  the Operating System (OS) or the hardware on which the `Instance` is run.
  Those differences are the source of a challenge in the deployment of
  `Instances` in configurations.

To illustrate this challenge, we consider the following example, illustrated in
  the figure below, where two `Endpoints` A and B are both running the same
  OS, here a Linux-based distribution using udev for device management, but on
  two different hardware platforms.

~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~

`Endpoint` A features an Ethernet interface which is located on the mainboard
  and is referred to as `eno0`:  *en* standing for "Ethernet",
*o* for "onboard", and *0* for "index 0" in the udev naming convention.

`Endpoint` B features an Ethernet interface which is located on a PCI bus and
  is referred to as `enp2s0`: *en* standing for "Ethernet", *p* for "PCI",
  *2* for "bus 2", and *s0* for "slot 0" in the same naming convention.

In this scenario, the `Context` which contains the Set of Rules (SoR) and parser
  ID, i.e. the configuration which is shared by all `Instances` of a `Domain`,
  provides no information on how to instruct the `Dispatcher` to route packets
  from the appropriate Network Interface to the appropriate `Instance`.

Without further configuration and unless the `Dispatcher` intercepts all packets
  from all network interfaces, we cannot guarantee the correct dispatching of
  packets to the appropriate `Instances`. Obviously, intercepting traffic from
  all network interfaces is not a viable solution, as it would require the
  inspection of all packets, regardless of their destination, which requires
  significant processing power and may introduce unacceptable latency on
  high-speed links.

Additionally, different OSes may use different filtering/dispatch frameworks,
  e.g. Netfilter on Linux, BPF on FreeBSD, PF on OpenBSD and macOS etc. This
  means that the foundation on which the `Dispatcher` implementation relies may
  vary significantly between different platforms and could require different
  configurations to dispatch packets to `Instances` based on the same `Context`
  but running on different `Endpoints`.

This assessment advocates for the introduction of a device-specific
  configuration that is independent of the `Context`, which we name `Profile`.

Such `Profiles` are `Endpoint` specific so their actual content is out of scope
  of this document. However, the `Profile` **SHALL** include the following:

- The configuration of the `Dispatcher`, i.e. the admission rules for
  compression and decompression.
- The rule matching policy, i.e. the policy used to select the appropriate
  compression or decompression rule based on the SCHC packet and the `Context`.

As the `Profile` is `Endpoint` specific, it is not shared between `Instances` of
  different `Endpoints`. However, the `Profile` required for a given `Instance`
  may need to change when the `Context` is updated, e.g. the filtering rules may
  need to be adjusted to account for the new traffic patterns and C/D rules.

This means that the `Profile` may need to be updated whenever the `Context` is
  updated, and that the `Domain Manager` **SHALL** therefore be responsible for
  managing the `Profile` delivery to `Instances` and their synchronization with
  the `Context`.

## The cold boot scenario

In this scenario, we consider the case where an `Endpoint` A is powered on and
  needs to establish a SCHC `Session` with another `Endpoint` B. `Endpoint` A
  does not have any `Context` or `Profile` stored in memory, and it needs to
  retrieve or negotiate this information before establishing the session.

  Two hypothetical scenarios are considered here:

  - *S1*. `Endpoint` A is provisioned on the appropriate `Domain` and is
    configured with the address/URI of the `Domain Manager` and
    `Context Repository`.
  - *S2*. `Endpoint` A is provisioned on the appropriate `Domain` but is not
    configured with the address/URI of the `Domain Manager` and
    `Context Repository`. In this scenario, the `Domain Manager` is in charge of
    advertising its presence and push the context to `Endpoint` A.

In scenario *S1*, `Endpoint` A initiates the configuration phase, effectively
  pulling the `Context` and `Profile` from the `Domain Manager` and the
  `Context Repository`. This scenario implies that the `Domain Manager` exposes
  a management interface that allows `Endpoints` to retrieve the necessary
  configuration information. Additionally, a logical component referred to as
  `Endpoint Manager` is required to manage the `Instances` of the `Endpoint`.

In scenario *S2*, the `Domain Manager` is in charge of advertising its presence
  and `Endpoint` A is pulling the `Contexts` and `Profiles` from it.
  The advertisement can be done using a discovery mechanism, such as DNS-SD or a
  predefined multicast address. This scenario implies that `Endpoints` are
  capable of discovering the `Domain Manager` and retrieving the necessary
  configuration information. This further requires that `Endpoints` feature a
  service discovery mechanism and a `Management Protocol` that enables them to
  interact with the `Domain Manager` and request the required `Context` and
  `Profile`.

In both scenarios, a management protocol is required to enable the retrieval
  of the `Context` and `Profile` from the `Domain Manager`. {{DRAFT-CORECONF}}
  provides initial ideas on how to implement such a management protocol for SCHC
  in a Constrained Environment, e.g. IoT devices.

# Core Components Illustrated

This section provides an overview of the SCHC Core components their interactions
and key functionalities and interfaces.

## Endpoint

An `Endpoint` is a network host capable of compressing and decompressing headers
  and optionally fragmenting and reassembling packets. It implements the SCHC
  protocol as defined in {{RFC8724}}. An `Endpoint` can host multiple
  `Instances`, each with its own `Context` and `Profile`.

When a `Endpoint` is supporting multiple `Instances`, the `Endpoint Manager` is 
  responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of these `Instances`. 
  Packets are routed to the appropriate `Instance` based on defined admission 
  rules by the `Dispatcher`. The `Dispatcher` is a single point of decision for 
  packet forwarding within the `Endpoint`.

The following figure illustrates the main components of an `Endpoint` supporting
multiple `Instances` and their interactions:

~~~~~~~~

In its simplest form, an `Endpoint` MAY implement a single `Instance` with a
  hardwired configuration, as described in {{DRAFT-SCHCLET}}. In this case, the
  `Endpoint Manager` and `Dispatcher` components are not required.


## Instance

An `Instance` is the fundamental component that implements a subset of the SCHC
  protocol as defined in {{RFC8724}}. An `Endpoint` MAY execute several 
  `Instances` in its protocol stack. Each `Instance` operates independently, 
  with its own context and profile.

An `Instance` implements a subset of SCHC functionalities, which at a minimum
  includes one of the following components:

* Header Compression and Decompression (C/D)
* Fragmentation and Reassembly (F/R)
* Acknowledgments

The `Instance` feature set is defined in its Profile, which at minimum includes
  a manifest of the SCHC features that are implemented.

Its configuration there MUST include:

* a SCHC Profile, which features at minimum a manifest of the SCHC features
  that are implemented.
* a SCHC Context, which defines the set of C/D and F/R rules - or Set of Rules -
  and the parser to be used to delineate the header field.
* a SCHC Profile, which defines the configuration of the Dispatch Engine, the
  rule matching policy, and the device-specific configuration.


A SCHC Instance MAY implement:

* Dynamic context update mechanisms.
* Performance monitoring and reporting.

### Header Compression and Decompression (C/D) engine

This component is responsible for compressing and decompressing headers
  using the SCHC protocol, as described in {{RFC8724}}. It applies the rules
  defined in the SCHC Context.

The C/D engine MUST expose the following interface:

- `compress(buffer, context, profile)`: Compresses the provided buffer using the
   SCHC Context and the profile.
- `decompress(buffer, context, profile)`: Decompresses the provided buffer using
   the SCHC Context and the profile.

Internally, on compression, the C/D engine:

- delineates the fields using the parser identified in the SCHC Context.
- chooses the appropriate compression rule based on the SCHC Context and the
  matching policy defined in the profile.
- applies the compression rule to the fields of the header.
- generates the compressed SCHC packet.

On decompression, the C/D engine:

- identifies the C/D rule based on the SCHC compressed packet.
- applies the decompression rules to reconstruct the original header.
- reconstructs the original packet from the decompressed header and payload.

### Fragmentation and Reassembly (F/R)

This component is responsible for fragmenting larger packets into smaller
  fragments and reassembling them at the receiving end. It is optional in
  the minimal architecture but recommended for scenarios where packet sizes
  exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying network.

### SCHClet considerations

In {{DRAFT-SCHCLET}}, the authors introduce the concept of SCHClets, which are
  modular components that implement a subset of SCHC functionalities, such as 
  specific compression or fragmentation algorithms, as a self-contained unit.


## SCHC Session

As illustrated in the figure below, the `Session` is a communication session
  between two or more `Instances` that share a common `Context`, i.e. they are
  part of the same `Domain`. It is established whenever the `Context` is updated
  or modified.

   Endpoint A                                  Endpoint B

   Endpoint C                                  Endpoint D

~~~~~~~~




## SCHC Domain & Domain Manager

The SCHC `Domain` is an administrative unit, whose role is to manage the SCHC
  Contexts of all `Instances` that belong to it. The `Domain Manager` is the
  component responsible for this management. It handles Endpoints Enrollment,
  and `Context` synchronization.

## Dispatcher {#sec-dispatcher}

The Dispatcher is responsible for delivering compressed packets to the correct 
  SCHC `Instance`. It ensures that the compressed packets are sent to the
  appropriate destination and that the decompressed packets are delivered to the 
  correct application or protocol routine.

The Dispatcher is a key component that enables the coexistence of multiple SCHC
  `Instances` on the same network host, allowing different protocols or
  applications to use SCHC compression and decompression mechanisms. It also
  allows regular traffic to coexist with SCHC-compressed traffic.

Dispatcher is illustrated in the figure below, where two SCHC `Instances`are
  running on the same `Endpoint`. The Dispatcher is responsible for routing
  packets to the appropriate `Instance` based on admission criteria defined in
  the `Profiles` and the `Contexts`.

~~~~~~~~

There are two types of admission criteria that are used by the Dispatcher:

1. `Discriminator` values for decompression and reassembly. Those criteria
   are used to identify packets that should be decompressed and reassembled by
   SCHC. The `Discriminator` is a value that is either included in the packet,
   such as a field in the packet headers (MPLS label, UDP port) or is derived
   from the metadata associated with the packet, such as the Network Interface
   ID, as described in {{DRAFT-ARCH}}.

2. `Matching Operators` and `Target Values` of the `Contexts` for compression
   and fragmentation. Those criteria are used to identify packets that should be
   compressed and fragmented by SCHC. The `Matching Operators` and `Target
   Values` are defined in the SCHC `Contexts` and are used to match specific
   header fields or values in the packet headers. The `Dispatcher` uses these
   criteria to determine whether a packet should be compressed or fragmented by
   a given `Instance`.

   

**TODO: LINK between discriminator, MO/TV and filter chains.**
**What follows is WIP, needs to be completed.**



## Context Management {#sec-context-management}

Context management is responsible for maintaining the shared state between
  SCHC entities. This includes:

* Context synchronization between entities
* Rule lifecycle management
* Profile distribution and updates

## Context Repository {#sec-context-repository}

A Context Repository provides centralized storage and management of SCHC
  contexts and profiles. While not mandatory for minimal deployments, it
  becomes essential for larger deployments requiring centralized management.

## Management Interface {#sec-management-interface}

A Management Interface provides operational control and monitoring
  capabilities for SCHC deployments. This may include:

* Configuration management
* Performance monitoring
* Troubleshooting tools

# Security Considerations

Security considerations for SCHC minimal architecture include:

* Context integrity and authenticity
* Profile distribution security
* Protection against context manipulation attacks

# IANA Considerations

~~~~~~

In this simple scenario, the Dispatch Engine is integrated into
  the network stack and there is a unique predefined SCHC Instance for a
  specific protocol stack, such as CoAP over UDP over IPv6. This is the classic
  case for SCHC over LPWAN networks, as described in {{RFC8724}}, {{RFC8824}},
  {{RFC9363}}.

The dispatching is done based on a identified header field, such as the an
  ethertype, the IPv6 Next Header field, a specific UDP port, etc.

This implementation scenario therefore assumes that the endpoint Operating
  System (OS) implements the SCHC protocol as part of its network stack and that
  SCHC is allocated the appropriate ethertype, IPv6 Next Header value or UDP
  port from IANA.

In the example above,

* On Endpoint 1, the Dispatch "intercepts" outbound packets whose UDP
  destination port is 5678, which is used by CoAP. It then routes these packets
  to the SCHC Instance for CoAP over UDP over IPv6. The SCHC instance
  then compresses the CoAP, UDP and IPv6 headers, and calls the Link Layer
  interface to send the compressed packet over the network, setting the
  appropriate SCHC ethertype in the link layer header.

* On Endpoint 2, incoming packets whose SCHC ethertype is set to the SCHC value
  are routed to the SCHC Instance for CoAP over UDP over IPv6. The SCHC Instance
  decompresses the SCHC packets and delivers them to the IPv6 layer.

Note that in this example, regular HTTP over QUIC traffic is also present on the
  same Endpoint. The Dispatch Engine is able to discriminate those packets from
  packets that are compressed by SCHC, as the HTTP over QUIC packets do not
  not match the admission rules defined in the SCHC profile, here
  `UDP Destination Port == 5678`.


Case 2: The Dispatch engine lives outside of the network stack.

In this case, the Dispatch Engine is a separate component that
  interacts with multiple SCHC Instances. It is responsible for routing packets
  to the appropriate SCHC Instance based on the packet type and supplied
  admission rules.

 - On Linux, this can be implemented using netfilter hooks or similar mechanisms
  to intercept packets and route them to and from the appropriate SCHC Instance.

 - On macOS, the Dispatch Engine can be implemented as a kernel extension or
  user-space application that make use of PF, the native packet filter.

The exact implementation details of the Dispatch Engine will depend on the
  Operating System, which therefore is not specified in this document. However,
  a description of packets criteria and admission rules is provided in the SCHC
  profile, which is used by the Dispatch Engine to determine how to route
  packets.

~~~~~~~

In the example above, the Dispatch Engine is implemented as a filter that
  intercepts packets based on their UDP destination port. In this instance, it
  routes packets with a destination port of 5768 to the SCHC Instance for CoAP
  over UDP over IPv6. The Dispatch Engine then compresses the CoAP, UDP, and
  IPv6 headers, adds a MPLS header with appropriate tag and sends the compressed
  packet over the network.

When receiving packets, the Dispatch Engine checks the SCHC ethertype and MPLS
  label and routes matching packets (MPLS label == 0xabcd0180 && UDP destination
  port == 5768) them to the appropriate SCHC Instance based on the defined
  admission rules in the profile.



## Parsing and Field Grouping Impact on Residue Size

When defining Compression/Decompression (C/D) rules in SCHC, the way fields are
  parsed and grouped must be homogeneous across all `Instances` that share the 
  same `Context`. This section illustrates how different parsing and grouping
  strategies breaks compatibility between `Instances` due to differences in
  residue size calculation.

~~~~~~~~
   Traffic Class
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|      DS     |ECN|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~

Suppose that the DS subfield assume the 5 following binary values: 

~~~~~~~~
      DS
    ------
    001010
    001100
    001110 
    010010
    010110
~~~~~~~~

Suppose that the ECN subfield assume the 3 following binary values:

~~~~~~~~
    ECN
    ---
    01
    10
    11
~~~~~~~~

Let's further assume that all combinations of DS and ECN values are valid.
The cartesian product of the two fields will produce the following set of 15 values:

~~~~~~~~
    001010 01
      ''   10
      ''   11
    001100 01
      ''   10
      ''   11
    001110 01
      ''   10
      ''   11
    010010 01
      ''   10
      ''   11
    010110 01
      ''   10
      ''   11
~~~~~~~~

Now suppose that a C/D rule is defined to match on the Traffic Class field as a 
whole (i.e., both DS and ECN bits) and use a Match-Mapping/Mapping-Sent MO-CDA. 
The size of the residue for this field would be log2(15) = 4 bits to cover all
possible combinations of DS and ECN values.

Alternatively, suppose that the "same" C/D rule is defined to match on the 
Traffic Class DS and ECN fields separately (i.e., two different fields). To 
cover all possible combinations of DS and ECN values, this C/D rule would 
require a residue of log2(5) = 3 bits for the DS field plus log2(3) = 2 bits for
the ECN field, i.e., a total of 5 bits.

This size mismatch shows that, when defining C/D rules, the way fields are 
parsed and grouped matters. In this example, parsing the Traffic Class field as
a whole results in a smaller residue size than parsing it as two separate fields.


## Context Equality vs Compatibility


Two SCHC Contexts are considered `equal` if they define identical sets of
  C/D and F/R rules, with the same Field IDs, Matching Operators, Target Values,
  and Residue Sizes.

Two SCHC Contexts are considered `compatible` if they define overlapping sets of
  C/D and F/R rules. This means that they may share some rules, but not 
  necessarily all of them. 

For example, consider three SCHC Contexts, Context A, Context B, and Context C
deployed respectively on Endpoint A, Endpoint B, and Endpoint C:

- Context A features 2 rules Rule 1 and Rule 2.
- Context B features 2 rules Rule 1 and Rule 3.
- Context C features 3 rules Rule 1, Rule 2, and Rule 3.

In this example:
- Rule 1 is common to all three Contexts. It is used as a base rule for 
  compression and decompression. It does not compress device-specific fields 
  such as device identifiers (.e.g. IP Source Addresses) but only common fields 
  (e.g. IPv6 Version, Next Header, UDP Destination Port).
- Rule 2 is specific to Contexts A and C. It compresses device-specific fields
  relevant to Endpoint A and C (e.g., IP Source Address of Endpoint A).
